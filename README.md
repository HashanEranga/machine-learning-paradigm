## 01_Exploring_Loss
using general python knowledge we can develop an algorithm to measure the loss

## 02_Minimizing_Loss
Define the loss function and training procedure, using a linear regression model, define the learning rate, instantiate a model. 

## 03_Simple_Neural_Network
define a neural network with one neuron. Used SGD as the optimizer. Use mean squared loss for measuring loss. creted model will be fitted using 500 epochs. Then predict the resul.
